## Abstract:

[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

A fullstack Next.js sports trivia application. Challenges users to guess a famous athlete based on the player's history & accomplishments. Incorrect answers are punished with a lowered score. Quicker answers result in a higher score.

## Preview:

[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

## Installation:

[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)

This app is current not deployable as it requires a matching local secret to render the 4 initial puzzles. If you'd like to help further develop this app, reach out & we can discuss a collaboration!

## Context:

[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)

This is a side project developed in my free time for the purpose of learning new technologies.

## Learning Goals:

[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)

- This app uses Next.js for a deployable fullstack application.
- The initial puzzles are being stored locally, but this app will soon integrate a PostGreSQL database & Drizzle ORM for db management.
- I'm currently developing specific webscrapers for each sport to allow for faster DB migration.
